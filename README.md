# HTML & CSS Challenge |Â Creating a Restaurant Menu for 'Vegan Haven'

In order to examplify and practise skills in HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript, this project tries to visually mimic the design of the menu of the made-up vegan restaurant 'Vegan Haven' according to coding best practises and conventions. 

With a few adjustments, this is the orginal design, which was used as a model for this project: 

<img width="946" alt="design example of restaurant menu with healthy looking food bowl in the background" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01de7db2-3943-4c2b-9986-8ced04fe9007">

## Adjustments

- Usage of [The Meal DB API](https://www.themealdb.com/)
- Change of colors for accessibility purposes
- Meal details displayed on hover, not on click.
